# Smart Wallet Permissions

**Permissions enable apps to submit transactions on behalf of users.**

Permissioned transactions can avoid typical user friction in web3 apps like:

- Wallet popup windows
- Passkey biometric scans
- User presence in-app

Permissions unlock experiences that keep all of the unique properties of wallets (self-custody, data portability, etc.) without sacrificing on user experience compared to web2:

- Sign-in and never see mention of a wallet again
- High-frequency transactions (gaming, social, etc.)
- Background transactions (automated trading, subscriptions, etc.)
