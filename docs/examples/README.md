## Get started

### 0. Integrate Coinbase Smart Wallet into your app.

The [smartwallet.dev](https://www.smartwallet.dev/guides/session-keys) docs are recommended.

### 1. Add support for permissioned user operations to call your smart contract.

If you do not yet have `forge` installed, first [install the foundry toolkit](https://book.getfoundry.sh/getting-started/installation).

```bash
forge install coinbase/smart-wallet-permissions
```

After installing this codebase as a dependency in your project, simply import and inherit `PermissionCallable` into your contract and override the `supportsPermissionedCallSelector` function to allow your functions to be called by permissioned userOps.

contract Contract is PermissionCallable {
    // define which function selectors are callable by permissioned userOps
    function supportsPermissionedCallSelector(bytes4 selector) public pure override returns (bool) {
        return selector == Contract.foo.selector;
    }
    // callable by permissioned userOps
    function foo() external;
    // not callable by permissioned userOps
    function bar() external;
}
```
